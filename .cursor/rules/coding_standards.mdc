# Coding Standards & Best Practices

## General Philosophy

1.  **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Complexity should be avoided. Simple solutions are easier to maintain and test.
2.  **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid duplicating code. Extract common logic into functions or shared components.
3.  **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)**: Do not implement features or abstractions "just in case" for the future. Implement what is needed now.

## Naming Conventions

Consistent naming is crucial for readability. Use the language's standard convention, but generally:

- **Classes / Interfaces / Types**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `UserRepository`, `PaymentService`).
- **Methods / Variables**: `camelCase` (e.g., `calculateTotal`, `isActive`).
- **Constants**: `camelCase` (e.g., `maxRetries`) or `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`), depending on specific language idiom (default to `lowerCamelCase` if unsure).
- **Files**: `snake_case` (e.g., `user_repository.ext`).

## Code Style

### Self-Documenting Code

- **Names over Comments**: A variable named `daysUntilExpiration` is better than `int d; // days until expiration`.
- **Small Functions**: Functions should do one thing. If a function is too long, break it down.

### Magic Numbers

- **Avoid**: `if (status == 2) ...`
- **Prefer**: `const activeStatus = 2; if (status == activeStatus) ...`
- Always extract literals (numbers, strings) into named constants if they have business meaning.

### Comments

- **Avoid Unnecessary Comments**: Code must be self-explanatory and expressive by itself. Use descriptive names instead of comments.
- **No Comments for Obvious Code**: If the code is clear from reading it, do not add comments. Prefer refactoring to make the code clearer.
- **Only Explain Why, Not What**: Code explains _what_ is happening. Comments should ONLY be used to explain _why_ a non-obvious business decision or workaround was made (rare cases).
- **No Zombie Code**: Do not leave commented-out code blocks. Use Git history for that.

### Error Handling

- **Explicit Handling**: Do not silently swallow exceptions. Log them or handle them meaningfully.
- **Result Pattern**: Consider using a Result/Either pattern instead of throwing exceptions for expected failures (e.g., "User not found").

### Null Safety

- **Avoid Nulls**: Design APIs to avoid `null` return values where possible. Return an "Empty" object or an `Option/Maybe` type.
- **Explicit Nullability**: If a value can be missing, type it explicitly as nullable (e.g., `String?`) and handle both cases.

### Documentation

- **No Proactive Documentation**: Do NOT generate documentation files (README, API docs, etc.) unless explicitly requested by the user.
- **Code is Documentation**: The code itself, with clear naming and structure, serves as the primary documentation.
- **Documentation Only When Requested**: Only create documentation files when the user explicitly asks for them.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Is the code simple and readable?
- [ ] Are names descriptive?
- [ ] Is logic duplicated?
- [ ] Are magic numbers replaced by constants?
- [ ] Are happy paths and edge cases handled?
